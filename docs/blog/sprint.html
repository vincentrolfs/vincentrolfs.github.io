  The other day David Whitney made an interesting comment about the word
  "Sprint":
</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>
    I kind of rue the day scrum normalised the term "sprint" for the
    connotations it carries.
  </p>

<p>
  It made me realize that I always found the term Sprint highly misleading. In
  fact, when I first learned about agile software development, I thought that a
  Sprint is something you do when you struggle to meet a deadline and you
  scramble to deliver something to your stakeholders. Of course, nothing could
  be further from the truth! In fact, the official
  <a href="https://www.scrum.org/resources/scrum-glossary" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
  Scrum Glossary
</a>
  writes: "Sprints are done consecutively, without intermediate gaps".
</p>

<p>
  Have you ever sprinted consecutively many times in a row, without intermediate
  gaps? Sounds like hell. Actually, a Sprint kind of sounds like the opposite of
  what it describes, which is a steady run of work, repeated week after week. On
  Mastodon I
  <a href="https://hachyderm.io/@vincentrolfs/109359088982735858" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
  proposed
</a>
  the term "Lap", as in a lap of a marathon. This seems to fit the meaning much
  better &ndash; at least one can imagine running many laps in a row.
</p>

<p>
  But all of this made me curious about the origin of the word. "Sprints" were
  apparently coined by Jeff Sutherland, who
  <a href="https://pm.stackexchange.com/questions/27932/why-is-scrum-iteration-called-a-sprint" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
  writes
</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    And so my team embarked on what we called "Sprints". We called them that
    because the name evoked a quality of intensity. We were going to work all
    out for a short period of time and then stop to see where we were.

      Time</em

  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
  Looking back, I guess this makes sense if you consider Sprint reviews and
  retrospectives apart from the Sprint itself. Nowadays most people work in a
  way where those things are seen as part of the Sprint, which only ends once
  the next one starts.
</p>

<p>
  And so our Sprints have become never ending, an ongoing toil with no
  respite...
