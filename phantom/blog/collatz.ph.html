<h3>Summary for a general audience</h3>

<p>
  There is an infinite binary tree with integer edge labels that starts like
  this:
</p>

<p><img src="/blog/collatz/collatz-tree.png" alt="Collatz tree" /></p>

<p>
  The labels can be defined recursively via the recurrence relation $R(x_0,
  \ldots, x_{k+1}) = R(x_1, \ldots, x_{k+1}) - x_0 R(x_0, \ldots, x_{k})$ and
  $R(x_0) = -x_0$. The values $x_i$ take values in $\szo$ and determine the
  "path" through the tree. For example, $R(1, 0, 1) = -2$, because you start
  from the root and go "right, left, right", which leads you to an edge labeled
  $-2$.
</p>

<p>
  The recurrence relation is somewhat similar to that of the signed Fibonacci
  numbers $F_n$, which start $-1, +1, -2, +3, -5, +8, \ldots$ and can be defined
  by $F_0 = -1, F_1 = +1$ and $F_{n+1} = F_{n-1} - F_{n}$. In fact, our tree $R$
  contains the signed Fibonacci numbers. You can reach them by alternating
  between "right" and "left" turns in the tree. In other words, $R(1) = -1, R(1,
  0) = +1, R(1,0,1)=-2, R(1,0,1,0)=+3$ and so on.
</p>

<p>
  The tree is also directly related to the Collatz conjecture. Recall the
  Collatz map $$ C(n) = \begin{cases} \frac{n}{2} \; &\text{ if $n \equiv 0 \mod
  2$ } \\ \frac{3n + 1}{2} \; &\text{ if $n \equiv 1 \mod 2$}. \end{cases} $$
  The Collatz conjecture is the famous statement that if you start with a
  positive natural number $n$ as your value, and you keep applying $C$ to your
  value, you will eventually reach $1$. It is well known that it suffices to
  show that the values $C^k(n)$ eventually alternate between odd and even
  values. That is because an odd step followed by an even step corresponds to a
  computation $C(C(n)) = \frac{3n + 1}{4}$ which is strictly decreasing for $n >
  1$.
</p>

<p>
  It is also well known that the map $C$ can be extended to the $2$-adic
  integers. In this larger domain, we can observe any desired odd/even behaviour
  in iterations of $C$. For example, say you want to find a starting value $n$
  which exhibits the following behaviour: $n$ is odd, $C(n)$ is odd, $C^2(n)$ is
  even, $C^3(n)$ is even, $C^4(n)$ is odd, $C^5(n)$ is odd, $C^6(n)$ is even...
  so we want to alternate between two "odds" and two "evens". In the $2$-adic
  integers, it is well-known that there is exactly one starting value $n$ that
  exhibits this behaviour.
</p>

<p>
  Here is the connection to the tree $R$. You can step through the above
  infinite tree and start with two right turns, then two left turns, then two
  right turns again, always writing down the labels you find. They will start
  $-1,0,1,-2,2, \ldots$. Call these labels $r_0, r_1, \ldots$. Then the $2$-adic
  number $n$ we are looking for will be given by $$ n = \sum_{i=0}^\infty 2^i
  r_i. $$
</p>

<p>
  Coming back to the Fibonacci numbers, since we can alternate "right" and
  "left" in the tree to get the numbers $F_n$, this procedure should yield a
  value $n$ which, under the Collatz iteration, alternates between "odd" and
  "even". That value is clearly $n=1$. In other words, the findings imply the
  well-known formula $$ 1 = \sum_{i=0}^\infty 2^i F_{i}, $$ which is neat!
</p>

<p>
  The point of this article is that the above tree links the Fibonacci numbers
  and the Collatz conjecture in a surprising way. The findings might open up an
  opportunity to study the Conjecture from a number theoretic perspective.
</p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>
  In this article we consider the Collatz map of the form $$ C(n) =
  \begin{cases} \frac{n}{2} \; &\text{ if $n \equiv 0 \mod 2$ } \\ \frac{3n +
  1}{2} \; &\text{ if $n \equiv 1 \mod 2$}, \end{cases} $$ defined on the 2-adic
  integers $\zp$. The Collatz-conjecture asserts that for positive natural
  numbers $n$, some iterate $C^k(n)$ equals $1$. It is well known that it
  suffices to show that the values $C^k(n)$ eventually alternate between odd and
  even values [1].
</p>

<p>
  An important tool in the study of the Collatz conjecture is the conjugacy map
  $\phi$, first considered in 1985 [1] and extensively studied by Bernstein and
  Lagarias [2]. Its inverse $\phi^{-1}$ can be defined directly via $$
  \phi^{-1}(n) := \sum_{k=0}^\infty (C^k(n) \mod 2) 2^k. $$ The function
  $\phi^{-1}$ thus encodes the parity of the iterates $C^k(n)$ as a 2-adic
  number. It can be shown [2] that the Collatz conjecture is equivalent to
  $\phi^{-1}[ \N_+ ] \subseteq \frac{1}{3} \Z$.
</p>

<p>
  The function $\phi$ maps a given 2-adic integer $x$, interpreted as an
  infinite stream of zeros and ones, to a 2-adic integer $\phi(x)$ whose
  behaviour under the Collatz iteration in terms of even/odd steps is precisely
  that stream. For example, the $2$-adic value $x = - \frac{1}{3}$ has 2-adic
  expansion $- \frac{1}{3} = (1,0,1,0,\ldots)_2$ and we have $\phi(-
  \frac{1}{3}) = 1$, because the value $1$ under the Collatz iteration
  alternates between odd and even steps.
</p>

<p>
  Perhaps surprisingly, it can be shown [2] that the map $\phi$ satisfies an
  explicit formula given by $$ \phi(x) = \sum_{k=0}^\infty 2^k\frac{x_k}{3^{x_0
  + \ldots + x_{k-1}}} $$ where $\sum_{k=0}^\infty x_k 2^k = x$ is the 2-adic
  expansion of $x$. This representation of $\phi$ involves an infinite sum of
  non-integer values.
</p>

<p>
  In this article we prove the following representation of $\phi$ as an infinite
  sum of integers: $$ \phi(x) = \sum_{k=0}^\infty 2^k R_k(x), $$ where $$ R_k(x)
  = \sum_{i=0}^k x_i (-1)^{1 + k-i} {k-i+(x_0+\ldots+x_{k-1}) \choose k-i}. $$
  The values $R_k(x)$ fulfill $R_0(x_0) = -x_0$ and the formula $$ R_{k+1}(x_0,
  \ldots, x_{k+1}) = R_{k}(x_1, \ldots, x_{k+1}) - x_0 R_{k}(x_0, \ldots,
  x_{k}). $$ The numbers $R_k$ can be seen as a natural generalization of the
  signed Fibonacci numbers, both because of the recurrence relation, and because
  they actually contain the signed Fibonacci numbers. Consider the alternating
  $x_0 = 1, x_1=0, x_2=1, \ldots$. With $F_k := R_{k}(x_0, \ldots, x_{k})$ we
  obtain $F_0=-1$ and the standard formula $F_{k+1} = F_{k-1} - F_{k}$ for the
  signed Fibonacci numbers $(F_k) = (-1, 1, -2, 3, -5, 8, \ldots)$. This also
  implies the well-known $2$-adic identity $1 = \sum_{i=0}^\infty 2^i F_{i}$.
  The numbers $R_k$ admit a natural visualization as an infinite binary tree
  with labeled edges, which we call $R$.
</p>

<p>
  More generally, we show that in the $p$-adic numbers ($p$ prime), the function
  defined by $H(n) = H_i(n)$ for $n \equiv i \mod p$ with $H_i$ of the form $H_i
  = \frac{n-i}{p} + a_i n + b_i$ admits an integer representation for the
  conjugacy map $\phi_H$, given by $\phi_H(x) = \sum_{k=0}^\infty 2^k R_k(x)$
  where $R_0(x_0) = x_0 - pb_{x_0}$ and $$ R_{k+1}(x_0, \ldots, x_{k+1}) =
  R_{k}(x_1, \ldots, x_{k+1}) - a_{x_0} R_{k}(x_0, \ldots, x_{k}). $$
</p>

<p>
  In the Collatz case, we have $a_0 = b_0 = 0$, $a_1 = b_1 = 1$ and $a_{x_0} =
  b_{x_0} = x_0$.
</p>

<p>
  The article starts with some brief general findings on iterating functions in
  $\zp$. We then introduce the concept of tree representations of contracting
  functions in $\zp$. With the main theorem, we then show how to derive a tree
  representation with a recurrence relation as above. Finally, we consider the
  tree $R$ for the Collatz conjecture, and state some of its properties.
</p>

<h3>Parity maps</h3>

<p>
  We work in $p$-adic numbers $\zp$ for $p$ prime, where there is a shift map
  $S$ given by $S(n):=\frac{n-(n \mod p)}{p}$ as defined in [2]. Consider any
  map $T\colon \zp \to \zp$. We define the
  <em>parity map</em> $\psi_T$ as $$ \psi_T(n) := \sum_{k=0}^\infty (T^k(n) \mod
  p) p^k. $$ The <em>parity map</em> encodes the parities that an iteration of
  $T$ produces. We find studying the parity map directly more fruitful than
  studying the conjugacy map studied in other articles [2].
</p>

<p>
  In this article, we focus on the case where $T$ is in a certain sense linear.
  The properties of $T$ can be better understood by expressing it in one of two
  normal forms. In this chapter we focus on defining those normal forms and give
  some motivation for considering them. The proofs in this chapter are omitted
  as they are not difficult and are not necessary for the main result of this
  article.
</p>

<p>
  The properties of the normal forms directly influence properties of $\psi_T$
  as well as the novel formulas for $\psi_T^{-1}$, which we will show in the
  next chapter.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Definition</strong><br />
  Given a map $T$ on $\zp$, its <em>first normal form</em> is the collection of
  maps $T_0, \ldots, T_{p-1}$ on $\zp$ given by $T_i(n) = T(np + i)$, so that
  for each $n\in \zp$ with $n \equiv i \mod p$, we have $T(n) =
  T_i(\frac{n-i}{p})$.
</p>

<p>
  The importance of the normal form is captured in the following Remark, where
  we remind the reader of the well-known fact that a distance-preserving map on
  $\zp$ is always surjective and thus an isometry.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Remark</strong><br />
  Given a map $T$ on $\zp$, the following statements are equivalent:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Each $T_i$ in the first normal form of $T$ is distance-preserving: $|T_i(n)
    - T_i(m)| = |n-m|$ for $n, m \in \zp$.
  </li>
  <li>$\psi_T$ is distance-preserving.</li>
  <li>
    $T$ is locally expanding in the following sense: For $n, m \in \zp$ with $n
    \equiv m \mod p$, we have $\abs{T(n)-T(m)} = p \abs{n-m}$.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Similarly, the following statements are equivalent:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Each $T_i$ in the first normal form of $T$ is contracting: $|T_i(n) -
    T_i(m)| \leq |n-m|$ for $n, m \in \zp$.
  </li>
  <li>$\psi_T$ is contracting.</li>
  <li>
    For $n, m \in \zp$ with $n \equiv m \mod p$, we have $\abs{T(n)-T(m)} \leq p
    \abs{n-m}$.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  <strong>Example</strong><br />
  In the case of the Collatz map $T=C$, we have $C_0(n) = n$ and $C_1(n)=3n+2$,
  both of which are clearly distance-preserving, so $\psi_C$ is an isometry.
</p>

<p>
  In the next chapter, we see how the first normal form directly informs an
  explicit formula for the conjugacy map $\psi_T^{-1}$. The same is true for the
  <em>second normal form</em>:
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Definition</strong><br />
  Given a map $T$ on $\zp$, its <em>second normal form</em> is the collection of
  maps $\hat{T}_0, \ldots, \hat{T}_{p-1}$ given by $\hat{T}_i(n) =
  T(n)-\frac{n-i}{p}$, so that for each $n\in \zp$ with $n \equiv i \mod p$, we
  have $T(n) = \hat{T}_i(n) + \frac{n-i}{p}$. Here $\hat{T}_i$ is defined on
  $\{n \in \zp \mid n \equiv i\}$.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Remark</strong><br />
  Given a map $T$ on $\zp$, the following are equivalent:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>Each $\hat{T}_i$ in the second normal form of $T$ is contracting.</li>
  <li>
    For each $T_i$ in the first normal form of $T$, the map $T_i$ is
    distance-preserving, and the map $T_i - \text{id}$ is strictly contracting:
    $|(T_i(n) - n) - (T_i(m) - m)| < |n-m|$ for $n, m \in \zp$ and $n \neq m$.
  </li>
  <li>
    The map $\psi_T$ is distance-preserving, and the map $\psi_T - \text{id}$ is
    strictly contracting.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  Note that for $p=2$, if $T_i$ is distance-preserving, then $T_i - \text{id}$
  is always strictly contracting. In $p=2$, we therefore see that $\hat{T}_i$ is
  contracting if and only if $T_i$ is distance-preserving.
</p>

<p>
  As for the first normal form we can state everything for the case of
  $\hat{T}_i$ distance-preserving. The following are equivalent:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Each $\hat{T}_i$ in the second normal form of $T$ is distance-preserving.
  </li>
  <li>
    For each $T_i$ in the first normal form of $T$, the map $T_i$ is
    distance-preserving, and the map $T_i - \text{id}$ is "exactly" contracting:
    $|(T_i(n) - n) - (T_i(m) - m)| = \frac{|n-m|}{p}$ for $n, m \in \zp$ and $n
    \neq m$.
  </li>
  <li>
    The map $\psi_T$ is distance-preserving, and the map $\psi_T - \text{id}$ is
    exactly contracting.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  <strong>Example</strong><br />
  In the case of the Collatz map $T=C$, we have $\hat{C}_0(n) = 0$ and
  $\hat{C}_1(n)=n+1$, both of which are clearly distance-preserving, so $\psi_C$
  is an isometry and $\psi_C - \text{id}$ is strictly contracting, which sounds
  interesting at first, but can be trivially verified by hand.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Definition</strong><br />
  A map $f$ on $\zp$ is called linear if it is of the form $f(n) = a n + b$ for
  some $a, b \in \zp$. Note: Such a map is always contracting. It is
  distance-preserving if and only if $a \not\equiv 0 \mod p$.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Remark</strong><br />
  The map $\hat{T}_i$ in the second normal form of $T$ is linear if and only if
  $T_i$ in the first normal form of $T$ is linear and the leading coefficient
  $a_i$ fulfills $a_i \equiv 1 \mod p$.
</p>

<p>
  In that case, if we have $T_i(n) = a_i n + b_i$, we have $\hat{T}_i(n) = (n -
  i) \frac{a_i - 1}{p} + b_i$.
</p>

<h3>Tree representations</h3>

<p>
  Any distance-preserving map is obviously contracting, and every contracting
  map has a convenient representation in form of a tree. Say $f$ is a
  contracting map on $\zp$ and consider two inputs $a, b \in \zp$. We call the
  coefficients in the base-$p$ expansion of $a, b$ their "bits". Since $f$ is
  contracting, it is clear that if $a$ and $b$ agree on the first $k$ bits, then
  $f(a)$ and $f(b)$ agree on their first $k$ bits (in fact, that is exactly much
  the definition of "contracting"). This means that the first $k$ bits of $f(a)$
  only depend on the first $k$ bits of $a$. We can thus write $f$ as $$ f(a) =
  \sum_{k=0}^\infty R_f(x_0(a), \ldots, x_k(a)) p^k \\ \text{where } a =
  \sum_{k=0}^\infty x_k(a) p^k \text{ and } x_k \in [p]. $$ where $R_f$ is a
  function defined on $\tp := [p] \cup [p]^2 \cup [p]^3 \cup \ldots$ with domain
  $[p]$. The map $R_f$ can be visualized as an infinite tree where each node has
  $p$ children. The label of the node reached after taking through the tree the
  path $(x_0, \ldots, x_k)$ has label $R_f(x_0 \ldots, x_k)$:
</p>

<p><img src="/blog/collatz/tree-labels.png" alt="Tree labels" /></p>

<p>
  We call maps from $\tp$ to $[p]$ <em>exact trees</em> on $\zp$. It is not hard
  to see that there is a one-to-one correspondence between contracting functions
  on $\zp$ and exact trees on $\zp$.
</p>

<p>
  However, exact trees as defined above are often hard to express explicitly. We
  thus define general trees as follows:
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Definition</strong><br />
  A <em>tree</em> on $\zp$ is a map from $\tp := [p] \cup [p]^2 \cup [p]^3 \cup
  \ldots$ to $\zp$. It can be visualized as in the image above.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Remark</strong><br />
  Any tree gives rise to a contracting function: If $R$ is a tree on $\zp$, and
  $a \in \zp$ with base-$p$-expansion $a = \sum_{k=0}^\infty x_k p^k$, then we
  define $$ f_R(a) = \sum_{k=0}^\infty p^k R(x_0(a), \ldots, x_k(a)) $$ and this
  is a contracting function. On the other hand, every contracting function has
  infinitely many tree representations, exactly one of which is exact.
</p>

<p>We now get to the main theorem of the paper.</p>

<p>
  <strong>Theorem</strong><br />
  Let $T$ be a map on $\zp$ whose second normal form is linear, so that for $n
  \in \zp$, $i \in [p]$ and $n \equiv i \mod p$, we have $$ T(n) = a_i n + b_i +
  \frac{n-i}{p} $$ for some $a_i, b_i \in \zp$.
</p>

<p>
  Define the parity map as before via $\psi_T(n) := \sum_{k=0}^\infty (T^k(n)
  \mod p) p^k$.
</p>

<p>
  Then the parity map is invertible, and its inverse $\psi_T^{-1}$ has a tree
  representation $R \colon [p] \cup [p]^2 \cup [p]^3 \cup \ldots \to \mathbb{Z}$
  given by $R(x_0) = x_0 - p b_{x_0}$ and the recursive formula $$ R(x_0,
  \ldots, x_{k+1}) = R(x_1, \ldots, x_{k+1}) - a_{x_0} R(x_0, \ldots, x_k) $$
</p>

<p>for $k \geq 1$.</p>

<p>
  In other words, for any infinite sequence $(x_k)$ with values in $[p]$, the
  value $n := \sum_{k=0}^\infty p^k R(x_0, \ldots, x_k)$ fulfills $$ T^k(n)
  \equiv x_k \mod p. $$
</p>

<p>
  In the case of the Collatz map $T = C$, we have $p=2$ as well as $a_0 = b_0 =
  0, a_1 = b_1 = 1$. The tree $R$ is thus given by $R(x_0) = -x_0$ and $R(x_0,
  \ldots, x_{k+1}) = R(x_1, \ldots, x_{k+1}) - x_0 R(x_0, \ldots, x_k)$.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Proof</strong><br />
  Since the second normal form of $T$ is contracting, $\psi_T$ is
  distance-preserving and thus bijective.
</p>

<p>
  Let $d \in \zp$ with base-$p$-expansion $d = \sum_{k=0}^\infty x_k p^k$. We
  want to show that $$ \psi_T^{-1}(d) = \sum_{k=0}^\infty p^k R(x_0, \ldots,
  x_k) $$ Set $n:=\psi_T^{-1}(d)$. We now define recursively a sequence of
  values $Q_k$ in the $p$-adic <em>numbers</em> (not just $p$-adic
  <em>integers</em>!): $$ Q_0 := \psi_T^{-1}(d) \\ Q_{k+1} := \frac{Q_k - R(x_0,
  \ldots, x_k)}{p}. $$ Note the following: If we can show that each $Q_k$ is in
  fact a $p$-adic <em>integer</em>, then we are done. This is because in that
  case, the sum $\sum Q_k p^k$ converges, and we can argue using telescoping as
  follows: $$ \sum_{k=0}^\infty p^k R(x_0, \ldots, x_k) = \sum_{k=0}^\infty p^k
  Q_k - \sum_{k=0}^\infty p^{k+1} Q_{k+1} = Q_0 = n = \psi_T^{-1}(d). $$ Because
  of this, we write $Q_k(n)$ and $x_k(n)$ for the values defined above. This is
  justified because these values depend on $d$ and therefore on $n$, since $d =
  \psi_T(n)$. Our goal is now to prove the following claim:
</p>

<p>
  CLAIM 1:
  <em
    >For all $n \in \zp$ and all $k \in \mathbb{N}_0$, we have $Q_k(n) \in
    \zp$.</em
  >
</p>

<p>
  Note that for any $n \in \zp$, we have $Q_0(n) = n \in \zp$, and also
  $a_{x_0(n)} \in \zp$. By a simple induction argument, it thus suffices to
  prove the following claim:
</p>

<p>
  CLAIM 2:
  <em
    >For all $n \in \zp$ and all $k \in \mathbb{N}_0$, we have $Q_{k+1}(n) =
    Q_k(T(n))-a_{x_0(n)} Q_k(n)$.</em
  >
</p>

<p>
  We now prove claim 2 by induction on $k$ and start with $k=0$. Note that by
  definition of the second normal form, we have $$ Q_0(T(n)) = T(n) = \frac{n -
  x_0(n)}{p} + \hat{T}_{x_0(n)}(n) = \frac{n - x_0(n)}{p} + a_{x_0(n)} n +
  b_{x_0(n)} $$ and thus $$ Q_0(T(n)) - a_{x_0(n)} Q_0(n) = \frac{n - x_0(n)}{p}
  + b_{x_0(n)} = \frac{n - (x_0(n) - p b_{x_0(n)})}{p} = \frac{n - R(x_0(n))}{p}
  = Q_1(n). $$ This settles the case $k=0$. Now we show the induction step $k
  \to k+1$.
</p>

<p>
  After rearranging, we need to show $Q_{k+1}(T(n)) = Q_{k+2}(n)+a_{x_0(n)}
  Q_{k+1}(n)$. At this point, it is important to recall that the values $x_k(n)$
  are defined as the base-$p$-expansion of $d = \psi_T(n)$. But $\psi_T$ is a
  parity map, so the base-$p$-expansion is simply $x_k(n) = (T^k(n) \mod p)$. In
  particular, we have $x_k(T(n)) = x_{k+1}(n)$. To finish up, by definition of
  $Q_{k+1}$, we have $$ p Q_{k+1}(T(n)) $$ $$ = Q_k(T(n)) - R(x_0(T(n)), \ldots,
  x_k(T(n))) \quad \text{(def. of $Q_{k+1}$)} $$ $$ = Q_{k+1}(n) + a_{x_0(n)}
  Q_k(n) - R(x_0(T(n)), \ldots, x_k(T(n))) \quad \text{(induction)} $$ $$ =
  Q_{k+1}(n) + a_{x_0(n)} Q_k(n) - R(x_1(n), \ldots, x_{k+1}(n)) \quad
  \text{(change $x_k$ arguments)} $$ $$ = Q_{k+1}(n) + a_{x_0(n)} Q_k(n) -
  R(x_0(n), \ldots, x_{k+1}(n)) - a_{x_0} R(x_0, \ldots, x_k) \quad
  \text{(recursive formula for $R$)} $$ $$ = p Q_{k+2}(n) + p a_{x_0(n)}
  Q_{k+1}(n). \quad \text{(def. of $Q_{k+2}, Q_{k+1}$)} $$
</p>

<p>This proves the main theorem.</p>

<p>
  <strong>Remark</strong><br />
  For completeness, we state a similar theorem based on the first normal form.
  The proof works the same way, but is simpler. The resulting formula has long
  been known for the case of the Collatz map; however, it might be less
  interesting, because it results in non-integer values.
</p>

  Let $T$ be a map on $\zp$ whose first normal form is linear, given by $T_i(n)
  = a_i n + b_i$ with $a_i \not\equiv 0 \mod p$. Then the parity map $\psi_T$ is
  invertible, and its inverse $\psi_T^{-1}$ has a tree representation $R \colon
  [p] \cup [p]^2 \cup [p]^3 \cup \ldots \to \mathbb{Z}$ given by $R(x_0) = x_0 -
  p \frac{b_{x_0}}{a_{x_0}}$ and the recursive formula $$ R(x_0, \ldots,
  x_{k+1}) = \frac{1}{a_{x_0}} R(x_1, \ldots, x_{k+1}) $$
</p>

<p>
  for $k \geq 1$. This implies the explicit formula $$ R(x_0, \ldots, x_{k+1}) =
  \frac{ x_k a_{x_k} - p b_{x_k}}{\prod_{i=0}^{k-1}a_{x_i}} $$
</p>

<h3>Investigating the Collatz case</h3>

<p>
  We now take a closer look at the implications for the Collatz map $$ C(n) =
  \begin{cases} \frac{n}{2} \; &\text{ if $n \equiv 0 \mod 2$ } \\ \frac{3n +
  1}{2} \; &\text{ if $n \equiv 1 \mod 2$}. \end{cases} $$ The tree $R$ is given
  by $R(x_0) = -x_0$ and $R(x_0, \ldots, x_{k+1}) = R(x_1, \ldots, x_{k+1}) -
  x_0 R(x_0, \ldots, x_k)$.
</p>

<p>
  Using induction, one can prove the following explicit formula for $R$: $$
  R(x_0, \ldots, x_k) = \sum_{i=0}^k x_i (-1)^{1 + k-i}
  {k-i+(x_0+\ldots+x_{k-1}) \choose k-i} = \sum_{i=0}^k x_{k-i} (-1)^{1 + i}
  {i+(x_0+\ldots+x_{k-i-1}) \choose i}. $$

<p>
  <strong>Remark</strong><br />
  The tree $R$ has the following properties for any $x_0, \ldots, x_k \in \szo$:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    $R(0, x_0, \ldots, x_k) = R(x_0, \ldots, x_k)$. Visually, this is the
    self-similarity in the left half of the tree.
  </li>
  <li>$R(x_0, \ldots, x_k) = R(x_0, \ldots, 0) - x_k$.</li>
  <li>
    $R(1, x_0, \ldots, x_k) = (-1)^{k} + \sum_{i=0}^k (-1)^{k+i} R(x_0, \ldots,
    x_i)$.
  </li>
  <li>
    Assume $y_1, \ldots, y_j \in \{0\}$ are all zero. If $j$ is even, then $R(1,
    y_1, \ldots, y_j, x_0, \ldots, x_k) = R(1, x_0, \ldots, x_k)$. If $j$ is
    odd, then $R(1, y_1, \ldots, y_j, x_0, \ldots, x_k) = 2 (-1)^{k
  </li>
</ol>
