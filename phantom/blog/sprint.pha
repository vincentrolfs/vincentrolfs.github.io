        <p>The other day David Whitney made an interesting comment about the word "Sprint":</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>
                I kind of rue the day scrum normalised the term "sprint" for the connotations it carries.
            </p>
            <p>
                <a href="https://mastodon.social/@david_whitney/109358975192675187">
                    <em>@david_whitney@mastodon.social</em>
                </a>
            </p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            It made me realize that I always found the term Sprint highly misleading.
            In fact, when I first learned about agile software development,
            I thought that a Sprint is something you do when you struggle to meet a deadline
            and you scramble to deliver something to your stakeholders. Of course, nothing could be further from the truth!
            In fact, the official <a href="https://www.scrum.org/resources/scrum-glossary">Scrum Glossary</a> writes: "Sprints are done consecutively, without intermediate gaps".
        </p>

        <p>
            Have you ever sprinted consecutively many times in a row, without intermediate gaps?
            Sounds like hell. Actually, a Sprint kind of sounds like the opposite of what it describes, which is a steady run of work, repeated week after week.
            On Mastodon I <a href="https://hachyderm.io/@vincentrolfs/109359088982735858">proposed</a> the term "Lap", as in a lap of a marathon. This seems to fit the meaning much better &ndash; at least one can imagine running many laps in a row.
        </p>

        <p>
            ðŸ”Ž But all of this made me curious about the origin of the word. "Sprints" were apparently coined by Jeff Sutherland, who <a href="https://pm.stackexchange.com/questions/27932/why-is-scrum-iteration-called-a-sprint">writes</a>:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>
                And so my team embarked on what we called "Sprints". We called them that because the name evoked a quality of intensity. We were going to work all out for a short period of time and then stop to see where we were.
            </p>

        <p>
            Looking back, I guess this makes sense if you consider Sprint reviews and retrospectives apart from the Sprint itself.
            Nowadays most people work in a way where those things are seen as part of the Sprint, which only ends once the next one starts.
        </p>

        <p>
            And so our Sprints have become never ending, an ongoing toil with no respite... ðŸ’€ <br/> And it's all due to an unfortunate misnomer.
