<h2>About me</h2>

<p>
  Hi, I'm Vincent! I am a <strong>senior-level software engineer</strong>. That
  means I am comfortable and experienced with complex development tasks such as
  writing parsers, performing security audits, improving software architecture,
  formulating long-term test strategies, and more.
</p>

<p>
  I am well-versed in TypeScript, Kotlin, PHP, Python, Java and SQL. I am also
  open to learning new programming languages for a particular project and have
  done so in the past. At the moment, I am focusing on learning Rust through my
  side projects.
</p>

<p>
  In my work, I strive for <strong>Holistic Engineering</strong>: I can help you
  plan, implement and support the entire software system from beginning to end.
  This includes technical aspects like the system’s frontend, backend, database
  and mobile apps, but also social aspects such as understanding the user’s
  needs and communicating concepts to non-technical people.
</p>

<p>I speak German and English fluently, as well as some Mandarin and French.</p>

<p>
  Feel free to <a href="/contact">message me</a> if you are interested in
  working together.
</p>

<p>
  I am currently building the customer portal for the biotech company Arcensus.
  We are dealing with highly sensitive medical data and have been repeatedly
  security certified by Silent Breach. As the software development lead, I am
  responsible for the technical guidance, code quality and daily cooperation
  with the product team.
</p>

<p>
  I am also developing the online learning platform TrainingsImpulse for the
  consultancy AeroImpulse.
</p>

<p>
  I have also worked on <a href="/my-work">these other projects</a> in the past.
