            About me
        </h2>

        <p>
            Hi, I'm Vincent! I am a <strong>senior-level software engineer</strong>. That means I am comfortable and experienced with writing parsers, performing security audits, improving software architecture, formulating long-term test strategies, and other complex tasks.
        </p>

        <p>
            I am well-versed in TypeScript, Kotlin, PHP, Python, Java and more. I am also open to learning new programming languages for a particular project and have done so in the past.
        </p>

        <p>
            In my work, I strive for <strong>Holistic Engineering</strong>: I can help you plan, implement and support the entire software system from beginning to end. This includes technical aspects like frontend, backend, database and mobile, but also social aspects such as understanding the userâ€™s needs and communicating concepts to non-technical people.
        </p>

        <p>
            I speak German and English fluently, as well as some Mandarin and French.
        </p>

            I am currently building the customer portal for the biotech company Arcensus.
            We are dealing with highly sensitive medical data and have been repeatedly security certified by Silent Breach. 
            As the software development lead, I am responsible for the technical guidance, code quality and daily cooperation with the product team.

            I am also developing the online learning platform TrainingsImpulse for the consultancy AeroImpulse.
