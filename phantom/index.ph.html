            About me
        </h2>

        <p>
            My name is Vincent Rolfs. I have more than ten years experience in developing complex applications on the
            web.
            I work as a freelance Software Engineer and IT-Consultant, with the goal of helping my clients build
            software
            that brings them and their users truly forward.
        </p>

        <p>
            I hold myself to the standard of always trying to build software which is a joy to use.
            Software should make our lives better and assist us in solving problems.
            But getting to that point is not always easy and involves more than just clean and reliable programming:
            It requires constantly asking yourself "What do our users need?"
        </p>
