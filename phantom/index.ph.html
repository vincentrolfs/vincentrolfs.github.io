<h2>About me</h2>

<p>
  Hi, I'm Vincent! I'm a passionate out-of-the-box thinker, question-asker, and
  programmer. I love creating things that makes other people's life better!
</p>

<p>
  I have a lot of experience building useful products with different programming
  languages and different teams. I'm good at coming up with practical solutions
  that make the users happy and keep the codebase clean.
</p>

<p>
  In my work, I strive for <strong>Holistic Engineering</strong>: I can help you
  plan, implement and support entire software systems from beginning to end.
  This includes technical aspects like frontend, backend, database and mobile
  technologies, but also social aspects such as understanding users’ needs and
  communicating concepts to non-technical people.
</p>

<p>
  Apart from work, I like to keep learning everything there is about coding, so
  I read a lot of articles on
  <a href="https://lobste.rs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lobste.rs</a> and
  build things like my templating engine phantom or the version control tool
  git-timemachine.
</p>

<p>I speak German and English fluently, as well as some Mandarin and French.</p>

<p>
  Feel free to <a href="/contact">message me</a> if you would like to have a

<p>
  I am currently building the customer portal for the biotech company Arcensus.
  We are dealing with highly sensitive medical data and have been repeatedly
  security certified by Silent Breach. As the software development lead, I am
  responsible for the technical guidance, code quality and daily cooperation
  with the product team.
</p>

<p>
  I am also developing the online learning platform TrainingsImpulse for the
  consultancy AeroImpulse.
</p>

<p>
  I have also worked on <a href="/my-work">these other projects</a> in the past.
