    I have supported Ecoworks in building a complex, business-critical cost-calculation and planning tool for the construction business. My main focus was on guiding team members, improving the software architecture and maintaining a high code quality.
For example, I introduced Redux in the frontend, which greatly simplified the handling of complex, global state changes. I also championed the use of Behaviour-driven development, which increased our trust in the correctness of our cost calculation. My biggest contribution was the development of a parser and interpreter for a Domain Specific Language for specifying complex cost calculations.
